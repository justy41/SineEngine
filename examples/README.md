### These are some example file like the main.cpp, two SineState scripts (basically scenes), an example CMakeLists.txt for the game and a Player folder that contains the player.cpp and a player.h files.

NOTE: This should be examined to see how the development process should go and the files should <ins>**not**</ins> be mindlessly copy-pasted into a project!
